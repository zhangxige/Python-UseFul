## Contributing to Python-UseFul üöÄ

I want to make contributing to Python-UseFul as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing a new feature
- Becoming a maintainer

I hope it works so well!

## Submitting a Bug Report üêõ

If you spot a problem with YOLOv5 please submit a Bug Report!

For us to start investigating a possible problem we need to be able to reproduce it ourselves first. We've created a few short guidelines below to help users provide what we need to get started.

When asking a question, people will be better able to provide help if you provide **code** that they can easily understand and use to **reproduce** the problem. This is referred to by community members as creating a [minimum reproducible example](https://docs.ultralytics.com/help/minimum_reproducible_example/). Your code that reproduces the problem should be:

- ‚úÖ **Minimal** ‚Äì Use as little code as possible that still produces the same problem
- ‚úÖ **Complete** ‚Äì Provide **all** parts someone else needs to reproduce your problem in the question itself
- ‚úÖ **Reproducible** ‚Äì Test the code you're about to provide to make sure it reproduces the problem

In addition to the above requirements, for [Ultralytics](https://ultralytics.com/) to provide assistance your code should be:

- ‚úÖ **Current** ‚Äì Verify that your code is up-to-date with the current GitHub [master](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/tree/master), and if necessary `git pull` or `git clone` a new copy to ensure your problem has not already been resolved by previous commits.
- ‚úÖ **Unmodified** ‚Äì Your problem must be reproducible without any modifications to the codebase in this repository. [Ultralytics](https://ultralytics.com/) does not provide support for custom code ‚ö†Ô∏è.

If you believe your problem meets all of the above criteria, please close this issue and raise a new one using the üêõ **Bug Report** [template](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/issues/new/choose) and provide a [minimum reproducible example](https://docs.ultralytics.com/help/minimum_reproducible_example/) to help us better understand and diagnose your problem.
