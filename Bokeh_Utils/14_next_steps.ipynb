You can use the Bokeh server to connect your\nJavaScript-based visualization running in a browser to Python code running on a server.\n\nThe following code cell displays an example of a Bokeh server app. The source code for\nthis Bokeh server app is available in the [Bokeh repository](https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/blob/main/examples/server/app/sliders.py).","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from IPython.display import display, IFrame\n\ndisplay(IFrame(src=\"https://demo.bokeh.org/sliders\", width=900, height=500))","metadata":{"trusted":false},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Bokeh server essentially synchronizes data between the underlying Python environment and\nthe BokehJS library running in the browser.\n\nSome use cases for Bokeh server include:\n- respond to UI and tool events in the browser with computations or queries using Python\n    code instead of JavaScript callbacks\n- stream real-time data from a server to a Bokeh visualization in a browser\n- quickly deploy a visualization for sharing with others\n- combine Bokeh server with NGINX or Apache to add authentication or other capabilities\n\nFor more information about Bokeh server, see\n[Bokeh server](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide/server.html)\nin the user guide.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### BokehJS as a standalone library\n\nBokehJS is the JavaScript library that takes care of displaying Bokeh visualizations\nin the browser.\n\nIn this tutorial, you have used Bokeh's Python API to create BokehJS code automatically.\nHowever, you can also use BokehJS directly in your own JavaScript code. This way, you\ncan combine BokehJS with frameworks like React or Vue, for example.\n\nFor more information and interactive examples, see\n[BokehJS](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/3.0.2/docs/user_guide/advanced/bokehjs.html)\nin the user guide. Note that the BokehJS API is considered experimental.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Bokeh extensions\n\nBokeh extensions are a way to add new functionality to Bokeh.\n\nFor example, you can create an extension to define a new tool for the toolbar or to\nwrap a third-party JavaScript library in a Bokeh model.\n\nFor more information and examples, see\n[Custom extensions](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/3.0.2/docs/user_guide/advanced/extensions.html)\nin the user guide.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Plotting with high-level tools (Panel, HoloViews, and hvPlot)\n\nBokeh is included in several high-level visualization tools. Depending on your use case,\nit may be easier to use these tools instead of Bokeh directly.\n\n#### Panel\n\n<a href=\"https://panel.holoviz.org/\" target=\"_blank\">\n    <img src=\"https://panel.holoviz.org/_images/logo_horizontal_light_theme.png\" alt=\"Panel logo\" style=\"height: 75px;\">\n</a>\n\n[Panel](https://panel.holoviz.org/) is a Python library for building interactive\ndashboards and web applications.\nIt provides a high-level reactive interface on top of Bokeh.\n\nPanel enables full interoperability between Jupyter notebooks and Bokeh server.\nThis lets you develop or prototype applications in a notebook and deploy them on a server.\nPanel also interfaces with other plotting libraries and lets you incorporate multiple\ndata-science artifacts into a single Bokeh application.\nFurthermore, the library includes a number of JavaScript templates to let you customize\nthe appearance of your Bokeh apps.\n\n\n#### HoloViews\n\n<a href=\"https://holoviews.org/\" target=\"_blank\">\n    <img src=\"https://holoviews.org/_static/logo_horizontal.png\" alt=\"HoloViews logo\" style=\"height: 75px;\">\n</a>\n\n[HoloViews](https://holoviews.org/) is a Python library for building data\nvisualizations in an automated way. It provides a declarative, high-level interface to\ndescribe and then visualize data.\n\nHoloViews focuses on interaction with Jupyter notebooks and enables quick prototyping of\nfigures for data analysis.\n\nFor example, building an interactive figure with three linked Bokeh plots requires only\none line of code in HoloViews:\n\n![HoloViews example](assets/hv_sample.png)\n\n### hvPlot\n\n<a href=\"https://hvplot.holoviz.org/\" target=\"_blank\">\n    <img src=\"https://hvplot.holoviz.org/_static/logo_horizontal.svg\" alt=\"hvPlot logo\" style=\"height: 50px;\">\n</a>\n\n[hvPlot](https://hvplot.holoviz.org/) is a concise API that lets you plot data from\npandas directly in Bokeh. It provides a ``.hvplot()`` function that you can use instead\nof the standard ``.plot()`` function.\n\nIn addition to tying into pandas, hvPlot also integrates with other libraries like\nxarray, dask, geopandas, and more.\n\nThis API is particularly convenient for working with data interactively. It helps you\nproduce common types of plots quickly.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Other resources for learning Bokeh\n\nThere are lots of resources available to help you learn Bokeh.
