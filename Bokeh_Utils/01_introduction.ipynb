While this is a beginner\ntutorial, there are some basic concepts that will be helpful to know before you start:\n\n* Bokeh is a Python library. You will need to know some **basic Python** to use this\n    tutorial. This includes:\n    - Python functions\n    - Python data types (str, int, float, dicts, lists, etc.)\n    - Basic data operations (slicing, indexing, etc.)\n    - Python classes\n* Bokeh is a data visualization library. It will help to have **basic knowledge of\n    [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)**, specifically the concept of a \n    [DataFrame](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/getting_started/intro_tutorials/01_table_oriented.html#min-tut-01-tableoriented).\n* This tutorial uses Jupyter notebooks. Therefore, some **basic knowledge of how to use\n    Jupyter notebooks** is helpful. You can find a quick introduction to Jupyter\n    notebooks in the [Jupyter documentation](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/notebook.html).\n* Bokeh runs in the browser, using JavaScript. Knowledge of JavaScript is not\n    required to use Bokeh and this tutorial. However, a basic knowledge of JavaScript\n    will be helpful in understanding some of the more advanced concepts you'll find\n    here.\n\nNote: This tutorial is focused on Bokeh. For clarity and brevity, most of the data\nprocessing necessary for the plots in this tutorial is done with pandas in a separate\nPython script.\nThis tutorial will reference the data preparation script but will not go into detail\nabout the data preparation itself.\nYou can find the data processing code in [`carriers_data.py`](../data/carriers_data.py).\n\nThis tutorial is designed to run on [mybinder.org](https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).\nYou can also run this tutorial locally on your computer.\nSee [README.md](../README.md) for instructions.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Where can I find more help and information?\n\nThere are several resources that go beyond the scope of this tutorial:\n\n* [**Bokeh user guide**](http://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide.html): A\ncomprehensive guide to all aspects of Bokeh.\n* [**Bokeh reference guide**](http://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/reference.html): A\ndetailed reference of all Bokeh models and functions.\n* [**Bokeh gallery**](http://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/gallery.html): A collection\nof examples that show how to use Bokeh to create different kinds of plots.\n\nYou will see the user guide, reference guide, and gallery referenced throughout this\ntutorial.\n\nThere are also many other resources that you might find helpful:\n\n* [**Bokeh first steps**](http://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/first_steps.html): A\nquick, high-level introduction to Bokeh.\n* [**Bokeh discourse**](https://discourse.bokeh.org/): A forum for users and developers\nto ask questions and discuss Bokeh.\n* [**Bokeh developer guide**](http://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/dev_guide.html): A\nresource for developers who want to contribute to Bokeh.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Next section\n\n<a href=\"02_installation_and_setup.ipynb\" target=\"_blank\">\n    <img src=\"assets/arrow.svg\" alt=\"Next section\" width=\"100\" align=\"right\">\n</a>\n\nIn the [next section](02_installation_and_setup.ipynb), you will learn how to install\nBokeh and set up your environment.\n\nLet's get started!","metadata":{}}]}
